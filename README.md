# No-rick-roll
A chrome extension that blocks you from being rick rolled.

# Download
You can download the extension here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/no-rick-roll/oljmncocnnpghpdnmdffphhcanpgmkok 
Or you could if you know how to compile it your self. But I would not recomend that you do that becouse it is mutch easyer of you download it from the storebecouse then you get updates.

# Disclamer
* I don't have any plans on supporting this software.
* I have not done a good job with the docs/comments. Good luck if you are thinking of contributing.
